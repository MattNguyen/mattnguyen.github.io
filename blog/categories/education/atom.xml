    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://matt-nguyen.tumblr.com/post/22890572560/on-life-and-moving-forward">(This Tumblr post</a> has been reposted to provide some continuity for my new site and life journey.)</p>


<p>For my inaugural Tumblr post, I feel obligated to update those who are close to me on what I have been doing, what I will be doing, and why I created this <strike>Tumblr account</strike>.</p>


<p>(TL;DR - I've been living in Austin as a project manager for the last year; I'm moving back to the Bay to do Dev Bootcamp and will forgo law school; I'm documenting my journey to inspire those who are considering the same path)</p>

<p><strong>What I've been doing</strong></p>


<p>After graduating from Cal in winter 2010, I moved to Southern California to work for <a href="http://www.gettrx.com">Global Electronic Technology Inc.</a>, a merchant services company specializing in payment processing solutions, with my degree in rhetoric in one hand and a suitcase full of clothes in the other. The plan was simple: I would take the next year and a half to develop my professional skills while preparing for law school. The job would be a stepping stone on my journey towards lawyerhood and served two purposes: one, since the company was moving to Austin, TX, relocating would strategically position me in the middle of the country where I could easily mobilize myself in the event I were accepted to a prominent law school on either coasts; and two, I would delay the inevitable soul crushing proffered by three years of intense legal studies.</p>


<p>Almost a year has passed since moving to Austin, and I am fairly certain that attending law school now will be a bad choice for a plethora of reasons, many of which were derived from reading through&nbsp;<a href="http://top-law-schools.com/forums/index.php">this law school forum</a>&nbsp;( an&nbsp;amazing resource for prospective law students). Although GET has been a great company to work for, I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself with computer science and web development. I began reading free online resources and participated in online courses, such as <a href="http://www.coursera.com">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>. After reading several blogs about learning strategies for computer science, I came across <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, a 10-week intensive Ruby on Rails program dedicated to turning individuals with no programming experience into "world class beginners." I applied, interviewed with <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSF-Shereef-Bishay-Open-Ente">Shereef Bishay</a>, received my acceptance, and submitted my deposit not too long after discovering this wonderful program (future post on the DBC application process forthcoming).</p>


<p><strong>What I'm going to do</strong></p>


<p>I am pretty damn excited about this, and it's hard not to be considering recent praise over <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/10/dev-boot-camp-is-a-ruby-success/">DBC's first cohort's employment results</a>. With 88% of the class receiving offers of $79k on average, becoming a web developer makes more economic and financial sense than attending law school, where <a href="http://insidethelawschoolscam.blogspot.com/2012/03/career-opportunities.html">recent graduates are struggling to find jobs</a>, are completely overwhelmed with <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/05/07/projected-law-school-debt-figures-revised-even-higher/">six figures of non-dischargeable debt</a>, and are seeking <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2012/02/twelve-more-law-schools-slapped-with-class-action-lawsuits-over-employment-data/">legal recourse against schools</a> who misrepresent employment statistics. From June 11 to &nbsp;August 17, I will be sharing an office space with approximately 40 other motivated students who are just as eager to learn RoR and launch their new careers as web developers. Already, the level of collaboration is high with students attending meet-ups and hack nights together, and the program hasn't even started! It will be interesting to see what we'll be able to accomplish at the end of the 10 weeks.&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Why I created this blog</strong></p>


<p>From being a prospective law student to becoming a web developer, I am compelled to document my story so that future generations of Booters can benefit from my experiences, and hopefully I can inspire people with non-technical backgrounds who are passionate about technology and motivated to switch careers to take the plunge and do something about it. I have not completely given up my aspiration for attending law school, but I have not found compelling reasons to do so right now. Perhaps when a future opportunity presents itself, I'll attend law school for intellectual property law *cough*Stanford*cough*Boalt*&nbsp;since I'll be in a much better position to do so as a web developer. In any case, I'm thrilled for this opportunity, and I absolutely cannot wait to see my friends, family, and meet my fellow Booters in the Bay.&nbsp;</p>
